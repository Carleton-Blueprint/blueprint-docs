It's already set up on our repo and very easy to use. Pick the component you want from their **[documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/)** and follow the installation instructions.

The components work with with **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/)** for theming so you can set className to change the styling properties.

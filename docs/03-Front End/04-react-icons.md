For generic icons we should use **[react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)**

The package is already set up so you can use the search or navigation menu on the left to find any icons you might need. Clicking on any icon will show usage instructions for importing and using the icon.

For example: 

```
import { GiHamburgerMenu } from  "react-icons/gi";
...
<GiHamburgerMenu className="size-7 text-white"/>
```

As you can see Tailwind CSS can be used here to style the icons

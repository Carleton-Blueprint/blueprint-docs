### Installation

1. Clone the [carletonblueprint.github.io](https://github.com/Carleton-Blueprint/carleton-blueprint.github.io) repository from GitHub. Ideally, you would use [GitHub Desktop](./05-Resources/02-Git.md) to accomplish this.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install` in the root directory of the project.
3. Create the `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project according to this guide: [Contentful API Keys](./04-Back%20End/01-Contentful.md).
4. Run the development server by running `npm run dev` in the root directory of the project.

:::warning[Blueprint Tip]

- If you get weird errors when running `npm run start` for the first time after switching branches, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again.
